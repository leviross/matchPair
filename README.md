# matchPair

First function takes as many string arguments as you like and returns a concatenated result of the string with a ' - ' between each argument. 

Second function is a famous challenge that luckily I think I just figured out. matchPair takes an array of numbers as 1st argument and a target number as 2nd argument and sees if any 2 elements in the array add up to the target number. 
Was fun:)
